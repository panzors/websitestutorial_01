# Website 101

This is meant as tutorial building exercise for me with the intention of helping anyone to start their own website. 

## Goal 1
Deploy a heroku site with both express and react site in the background. I will need ability build my assets and serve them up using express.

### Disclaimer
I'll try my best to explain things in simple terms. I'm not the best at it.

### Free to use
Please let me know if you have feedback for this, I'd like to know what is helpful and what is not.

### What you will need
1. Understanding of basic computers
2. Html/Javascript (of course copy and pasting and figuring it out is fine too. I'll do my best to explain)
3. Willingness and patience. Some things will not be so easy. Your dreams need to start small.
4. Typescript
5. Logging
6. STATE MANAGEMENT WHICH I'M WORKING ON MYSELF
